# EvalEx Examples

This directory contains example scripts demonstrating EvalEx's evaluation capabilities.

## Running Examples

All examples can be run from the project root:

```bash
# Run a specific example
mix run examples/basic_usage.exs

# Run all examples
./examples/run_all.sh
```

## Writing Your Own Examples

Examples should:

1. Be self-contained with no external dependencies beyond EvalEx
2. Use realistic sample data
3. Include clear output with labeled results
4. Demonstrate multiple features together when appropriate
